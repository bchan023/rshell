# features

For this assignment you will add the test command to your rshell, as well as its symbolic
equivalent [ ]. The square brackets [ ] are actually set up as the test command in bash.
This command returns 0 (TRUE) if the test
succeeds and 1 (FALSE) if the test fails. This command is very useful for writing conditions that
can be combined with &amp;&amp; and || to write more complex bash command structures.

-e checks if the file/directory exists

-f checks if the file/directory exists and is a regular file

-d checks if the file/directory exists and is a directory


some features of echo with AND, OR

------------------------

# bugs

1) square brackets does not always work, needs fixing

2) several echo combinations with and, or will not work.

3) some unknown ones?
